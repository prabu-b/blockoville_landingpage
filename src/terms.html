            <p>Subject to the Terms of Service, Blockoville provides the Website Services to Users, including hosting
              and maintaining the Website and the Platform, facilitating the formation of Service Contracts, and
              assisting Users in resolving disputes which may arise in connection with those Service Contracts. When a
              User enters a Service Contract, the User uses the Site to invoice and pay any amounts owed under the
              Service Contract.</p>
            <ol start="4">
              <li><strong> DIGITAL CURRENCY SERVICES</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>4.1. The following services may be provided to you by Blockoville:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>one or more hosted digital currency wallets enabling you to store, track, transfer, and manage your
                balances of certain supported digital currencies (the "Digital Currency Wallet" and "Digital Currency"
                respectively); and</li>
              <li>a Digital Currency exchange service enabling you to obtain prices for your purchases and sales of
                Digital Currencies, and (subject to certain restrictions) carry out any such purchases or sales on the
                Site.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>4.2. You may purchase supported Digital Currency by linking a valid payment method to your Digital
              Currency Wallet. You authorise us to debit funds using your selected payment method(s) to complete your
              purchase.</p>
            <p>4.3. By clicking the &lsquo;Buy&rsquo; or &lsquo;Sell&rsquo; button on the Website, you are authorising
              Blockoville to initiate the transaction at the quoted Buy Price or Sell Price and agree to any associated
              Conversion Fees and Exchange Fees. You cannot cancel, reverse, or change any transaction marked as
              complete or pending. If your payment is not successful or if your payment method has insufficient funds,
              you authorise us, in our sole discretion, either to cancel the transaction or to debit your other payment
              methods, including balances on your Digital Currency Wallets, in any amount necessary to complete the
              transaction. You are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance and/or sufficient credit limits in
              order to avoid overdraft, insufficient funds, or similar fees charged by your payment provider.</p>
            <p>4.4. Although we will attempt to deliver Digital Currency to you as promptly as possible, funds may be
              debited from your selected payment method before the status of your Digital Currency transaction is shown
              as complete, and it is delivered to your Digital Currency Wallet. You may sell Digital Currency in
              exchange for fiat currency supported by Blockoville. In such circumstances, you authorise us to debit your
              Digital Currency Wallet and to send instructions to credit your selected payment method(s) in settlement
              of sell transactions. We will send these instructions as soon as reasonably possible. Any fiat currency
              should be credited to your selected payment method(s) by the end of the business day after we send such
              instructions. We may also refuse to process or cancel any pending Digital Currency Transaction as required
              by law, regulation or any court or other authority to which Blockoville is subject in any jurisdiction</p>
            <p>4.5. We will make reasonable efforts to fulfil all purchases of Digital Currency, but in some
              circumstances, we may be unable to. If this is the case, we will notify you and seek your approval to
              re-attempt the purchase at the current Exchange Rate.</p>
            <p>4.6. The &ldquo;Conversion Fee&rdquo; is a fee each purchase or sale of Digital Currency is subject to.
              The applicable Conversion Fee will be displayed to you on the Website prior to each transaction and is
              stated in each receipt we issue to you. We may adjust our Conversion Fees at any time. We will not process
              a transaction if the Conversion Fee and any other associated fees would, together, exceed the value of
              your transaction.</p>
            <p>4.7. The "Exchange Rate" means the price of a given supported Digital Currency in fiat currency as quoted
              on the Site.</p>
            <p>4.8. Blockoville has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any
              other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase from, or sell to, any third party (including
              other users of the Digital Currency Services). We are not responsible for ensuring that a third party
              buyer or a seller you transact with will complete the transaction or is authorised to do so. If you
              experience a problem with any goods or services purchased from, or sold to, any third party using Digital
              Currency transferred using the Digital Currency Services, or if you have a dispute with such third party,
              you should resolve the dispute directly with that third party.</p>
            <ol start="5">
              <li><strong> FREELANCING PLATFORM</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>5.1. Blockoville makes the Website and Website Services available to enable Freelancers and Clients to
              find and transact directly with each other. Blockoville does not introduce Freelancers to Clients, find
              Projects for Freelancers, or find Freelancers for Clients. Through the Website and Website Services,
              Freelancers may be notified of Clients that may be seeking the services they offer, and Clients may be
              notified of Freelancers that may offer the services they seek; at all times, however, Users are
              responsible for evaluating and determining the suitability of any Project, Client or Freelancer on their
              own. If Users decide to enter into a Service Contract, the Service Contract is directly between the Users
              and Blockoville is not a party to that Service Contract.</p>
            <p>5.2. If a Client and Freelancer decide to enter into a Service Contract, the Service Contract is a
              contractual relationship directly between the Client and Freelancer. Client and Freelancer have complete
              discretion both with regard to whether to enter into a Service Contract with each other and with regard to
              the terms of any Service Contract. You acknowledge, agree, and understand that Blockoville is not a party
              to any Service Contract, that the formation of a Service Contract between Users will not, under any
              circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between Blockoville and any Freelancer or
              a partnership or joint venture between Blockoville and any User.</p>
            <p>5.2. You acknowledge, agree, and understand that Blockoville is not a party to the relationship or any
              dealings between Client and Freelancer. Without limitation, Users are solely responsible for (a) ensuring
              the accuracy and legality of any User Content, (b) determining the suitability of other Users for a
              Service Contract, (c) negotiating, agreeing to, and executing any terms or conditions of Service
              Contracts, (d) performing Freelancer Services, or (e) paying for Service Contracts or Freelancer Services.
              You acknowledge, agree, and understand that Blockoville does not, in any way, supervise, direct, control,
              or evaluate Freelancers or their work and is not responsible for any Project, Project terms or Work
              Product. Blockoville makes no representations about and does not guarantee, and you agree not to hold
              Blockoville responsible for, the quality, safety, or legality of Freelancer Services; the qualifications,
              background, or identities of Users; the ability of Freelancers to deliver Freelancer Services; the ability
              of Clients to pay for Freelancer Services; User Content, statements or posts made by Users; or the ability
              or willingness of a Client or Freelancer to actually complete a transaction.</p>
            <p>5.3. You also acknowledge, agree, and understand that Freelancers are solely responsible for determining,
              and have the sole right to determine, which Projects to accept; the time, place, manner, and means of
              providing any Freelancer Services; the type of services they provide; and the price they charge for their
              services or how that pricing is determined or set.</p>
            <p>5.4. You further acknowledge, agree, and understand that: (i) Blockoville will not have any liability or
              obligations under or related to Service Contracts and/or Freelancer Services for any acts or omissions by
              you or other Users; (ii) Blockoville does not, in any way, supervise, direct, or control any Freelancer or
              Freelancer Services; does not impose quality standards or a deadline for completion of any Freelancer
              Services; and does not dictate the performance, methods or process Freelancer uses to perform services;
              (iii) Freelancer is free to determine when and if to perform Freelancer Services, including the days
              worked and time periods of work, and Blockoville does not set or have any control over Freelancer&rsquo;s
              pricing, work hours, work schedules, or work location, nor is Blockoville involved in any other way in
              determining the nature and amount of any compensation that may be charged by or paid to Freelancer for a
              Project; (iv) Freelancer will be paid at such times and amounts as agreed with a Client in a given Service
              Contract, and Blockoville does not, in any way, provide or guarantee Freelancer a regular salary or any
              minimum, regular payment; (v) Blockoville does not provide Freelancers with training or any equipment,
              labor, tools, or materials related to any Service Contract; and (vi) Blockoville does not provide the
              premises at which Freelancers will perform the work.</p>
            <p>5.5. Freelancers are free to use subcontractors or employees to perform Freelancer Services and may
              delegate work to Freelancer&rsquo;s subcontractor(s) or employee(s). If a Freelancer uses subcontractors
              or employees, Freelancer further agrees and acknowledges that this paragraph applies to
              Blockoville&rsquo;s relationship, if any, with Freelancer&rsquo;s subcontractors and employees as well and
              Freelancer is solely responsible for Freelancer&rsquo;s subcontractors and employees.</p>
            <p>5.6. Blockoville will facilitate payments between Client and Freelancer.</p>
            <p>5.7. For the purposes of facilitating the payment, the Client must provide account information for at
              least one valid Payment Method. By providing Payment Method information through the Website and
              authorizing payments with the Payment Method, Client represents, warrants, and covenants that: (a) Client
              is legally authorized to provide such information; (b) Client is legally authorized to make payments using
              the Payment Method(s); (c) if Client is an employee or agent of a company or person that owns the Payment
              Method, that Client is authorized by the company or person to use the Payment Method to make payments on
              Blockoville; and (d) such actions do not violate the terms and conditions applicable to Client&rsquo;s use
              of such Payment Method(s) or applicable law. When Client authorizes a payment using a Payment Method via
              the Site, Client represents and warrants that there are sufficient funds or credit available to complete
              the payment using the designated Payment Method. To the extent that any amounts owed under theseTerms and
              Conditions cannot be collected from Client&rsquo;s Payment Method(s), Client is solely responsible for
              paying such amounts by other means.</p>
            <p>5.8. Because the use of any Payment Method may be limited by applicable law or by written agreement with
              your financial institution, Blockoville is not liable to any User if Blockoville does not complete a
              transaction as a result of any such limit, or if a financial institution fails to honor any credit or
              debit to or from an account associated with such Payment Method. Blockoville will make commercially
              reasonable efforts to work with any such affected Users to resolve such transactions in a manner
              consistent with these Terms and Conditions.</p>
